<script type="module" src="./App.jsx"></script>

Because file systems are case-sensitive, this can cause a 404 error when trying to load the script.
To fix this, you have two options (I recommend Option 1, as it's cleaner):
Option 1 (Recommended): Rename Index.html to index.html
 * Go back to your TRADECOINco repository files list.
 * Tap on the file named Index.html.
 * Tap the Edit (pencil) icon.
 * Near the top, where the file name is, change Index.html to index.html.
 * Scroll to the bottom and tap Commit changes... (the green button).
Option 2 (If Option 1 fails): Edit the Index.html Content
 * Go back to your TRADECOINco repository files list.
 * Tap on the file named Index.html (the capital 'I' one).
 * Tap the Edit (pencil) icon.
 * Change line 16 from:
   <script type="module" src="./App.jsx"></script>

   to:
   <script type="module" src="./App.jsx"></script>
